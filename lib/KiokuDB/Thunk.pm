=head1 NAME

KiokuDB::Thunk - Internal only placeholder for deferred objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # do not use directly,
    # KiokuDB::Meta::Attribute::Lazy, KiokuDB::Meta::Instance and
    # KiokuDB::TypeMap::Entry::MOP will do the actual thunking of data so that
    # the thunk will never be visible unless you break encapsulation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an internal placeholder object. It will be used on attributes that you
mark with L<KiokuDB::Meta::Attribute::Lazy> automatically, and should never be
visible to the user because L<KiokuDB::Meta::Instance> will automatically
inflate it before it's even seen by the accessor's code.
